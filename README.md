# PHI_FLOW
Mobile applications are widely used by individuals and by
organizations in the health industry. It is forecasted that
in 2022, there will be 86.3 million users of health or fitness
apps in the United States, which is 30% of adult smartphone
users 1. To provide services, these applications collect users’
personal data which is protected health information (PHI).
It is obligatory for these applications to provide safeguards
for such information in addition to getting permissions from
users (enforced by platforms like Android/iOS). In case of
a breach, the data and financial loss are irrecoverable. So,
this sensitive health data should be breach-proof while held
by applications. In this study, we examine such applications
using taint analysis, a static analysis method for identifying
information leakage from applications. We gather empirical
data of possible application providers’ intended use case for
users and if this leakage is in the wrong hands (Attacker)
what can be major consequences. The purpose of our study is
to make an organized dataset (which is currently not widely
available) for future research applications and provide possi-
ble resolutions to avoid PHI compromises from application
developers. Moreover, regulatory bodies can use this data to
safeguard users providing compliance information.
